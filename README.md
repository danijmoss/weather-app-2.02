# weather-app-2.02
Second version of the forecast shown in Persona 4 when the day changes. This Weather App was created as a FreeCodeCamp project using the DakySky API, the Weather Icons CSS library, Moment.js, Google Maps API, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The layout is inspired by the day change animation that plays in the game Persona 4.

The Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Qwicksilver/pen/bgqdZa.
